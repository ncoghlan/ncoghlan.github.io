    <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Spideroak's launch of <a href="https://crypton.io/">Crypton</a> prompted an interesting discussion on Twitter between myself and a few others. This mostly involved some fairly common "open source" versus "free software" objections to the use of the AGPL for the open source project as a marketing tactic to drive sales of commercial licenses for Spideroak. That conversation prompted me to post the following:<br><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Remember folks, the typical alternative to (A)GPL isn't a permissive license, it's proprietary source code and a proliferation of NDAs :P<br>— Nick Coghlan (@ncoghlan_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev/status/306387109130928131">February 26, 2013</a>
</blockquote>
<br>Myself, I'm lazy, so I'm a fan of permissive licensing - this blog is CC0, and the open source stuff I write and license entirely myself uses the Simplified BSD License (which only has 2 clauses in it, and is pretty much limited to disclaiming warranties and saying "Hey, I wrote this"). Those license choices accurately reflect the effort I'm prepared to put into enforcing the legal rights I receive by default under current copyright regimes: absolutely none.<br><br>However, I'm not dependent on that software or this blog for my livelihood - they're a hobby, something I do because I want to, not because I need to. My lack of concern about these matters is a luxury and a privilege, because I don't need to worry about where my next meal is coming from - I have a stable job for that, with an employer I thoroughly respect and greatly enjoy working for.<br><br>Plenty of people and organizations around the world have gained value from my hobby (and will likely gain more in the future), and the pay-off I see personally is purely in terms of immediate enjoyment, long term reputation gain, and the opportunity to meet and become friends with interesting people I would never have encountered otherwise.<br><br>That means it saddens me when companies that are making their software freely available to the world are derided for <i>not being open enough</i> when they make the strategic decision to employ a dual licensing model, and also choose to use the GPL or AGPL to create an enforced commons on the open source side, thus making the commercial offering more attractive. They get accused of wanting to "exploit" the developers that might choose to participate in their project, because the sponsoring company controls the copyrights and can issue commercial licenses, while the third party developers "only" get to use (and customise, and redistribute) the software for free.<br><br>Being able to categorically deny such accusations is definitely one of the advantages of a "license in = license out" model for a sponsored project, where the original sponsor quickly becomes bound by the same license obligations as everyone else, but dual licensing is still several orders of magnitude better than keeping a solution proprietary.<br><br>There are <i>many</i> potential consumers who will consider being able to <i>use</i> software as more important than being able to redistribute it under a more permissive or closed license, and even for those that eventually decide they want a commercial license, dual licensing allows true "try before you buy" evaluation (since even the AGPL doesn't really kick in if you're not making your service available to the general public over the internet). Even the most ardent GPL detractors are also likely happy to <i>use</i> GPL software when it meets their needs, whether that's in the form of an OS (Linux), or cryptographic software (GPG), etc.<br><br>The strategic fears that lead many companies taking their hesitant first steps into the open source arena to favour copyleft licenses over permissive ones shouldn't be dismissed lightly. I'm young enough that I only caught the tail end of the proprietary Unix wars (mostly through antiquated platform specific cruft in the CPython code base), but I personally lay a lot of the credit for Linux avoiding the fragmented state of AIX/IRIX/Tru64/HP-UX/Solaris at the feet of the GPL. The legal strength of the GPL means that competitors with no reason to trust each other at the strategic level can still collaborate effectively at a technical level (up to a point, anyway).<br><br>The free software world is still a minnow in the overall software development picture, the vast majority of which is still bespoke intranet deployments. Even when those deployments are based on free or open source software, it's hardly likely to be used as a selling point to those customers. Regardless of high profile tech companies like Google and Amazon, the "cloud" is still in its infancy, and it is going to be a long time before many organisations are willing to trust cloud providers with their data. In the meantime, the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and IBM continue to make money hand over fist. Red Hat may be huge by open source company standards, and have some high profile customers, but we still have a long way to go before we're even close to matching the proprietary giants in scale and ubiquity.<br><br>The battle to convince people that sharing leads to better software is <i>not</i> over by any means. It still needs to be fought, and fought hard, until paying for proprietary software rather than certified open source software is an unusual aberration rather than the norm that it still is today.<br><br>The friendly fire often directed by advocates of permissive licensing against those that choose to enforce an open commons to assuage understandable fears is <i>not</i> helpful in that broader fight. We should be celebrating the fact that another company has taken a step towards open development, rather than lamenting the fact they didn't travel all the way from proprietary to permissive licensing in one flying leap. </div>

    <p>Inspired by Noufal Ibrahim's <a href="http://www.devworx.in/features/the-state-of-python-in-india-136921.html">recent article</a> on the general state of the Python community in India, I've finally written this belated report on my recent India trip :)<br><br>At the end of October, I had the good fortune to attend PyCon India 2012 in Bangalore. Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay (from Red Hat's Pune office) suggested I submit some talk proposals a few months earlier, and I was able to combine a trip to attend the conference with visits to the Red Hat offices in Bangalore and Pune. It's always good to finally get to associate IRC nicks and email addresses with people that you've actually met in person! While Sankarshan unfortunately wasn't able to make it to the conference himself, I did get to meet him when I visited Pune, and Kushal Das and Ramakrishna Reddy (also fellow Red Hatters) took great care of me while I was over there (including a weekend trip out from Pune to see the Ajanta and Ellora caves - well worth the visit, especially if you're from somewhere like Australia with no human-built structures more than a couple of hundred years old!)<br><br>While I wasn't one of the keynote speakers (David Mertz gave the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJseJV6RLUg">Saturday keynote</a>, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss gave an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ydxV6gYXL4">"State of the Python Web"</a> keynote on Sunday), I did give a couple of talks - one on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqidFaoNmP8&amp;feature=plcp">new features in the recent Python 3.3 release</a>, along with a longer version of the Path Dependent Development talk that I had previously presented at PyCon AU in August. Both seemed to go over reasonably well, and people liked the way Ryan Kelly's "playitagainsam" and "playitagainsam-js" tools allowed me to embed some demonstration code directly in the HTML5 presentation for the Python 3.3 talk.<br><br>Aside from giving those two talks, this was a rather different conference for me, as I spent a <i>lot</i> more time in the hallway chatting with people than I have at other Python conferences. It was interesting to see quite a few folks making the assumption that because I'm a core developer, I must be an expert on all things Python, when I'm really a relative novice in many specific application areas. Fortunately, I was able to pass the many web technology related questions on to Jacob, so people were still able to get good answers to their questions, even when I couldn't supply them myself. I also got to hear about some interesting projects people are working on, such as an IVRS utility for mothers to call to find out about required and recommended vaccinations for their newborn children (I alluded to this previously in <a href="2012/10/pythons-future-global-perspective.html">my post</a> about my perspective on Python's future prospects).<br><br>One thing unfortunately missing from the PyCon India schedule was the target experience level for the talks, so I did end up going to a couple of talks that, while interesting and well presented introductions to the topic, didn't actually tell me anything I didn't already know. Avoiding any chance of that outcome is one of the reasons I really like attending "How we are using Python" style talks, and my favourite talk of the conference (aside from Jacob's keynote) was actually the one from Noufal Ibrahim and Anand Chitipothu on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDlOpMDwb-Q&amp;feature=plcp">rewriting the Wayback Machine's archiving system</a> (The other major reason I like attending such talks is that knowing I played a part, however small, in making these things possible is just plain <i>cool</i>).<br><br>While the volunteers involved put in a lot of effort and the conference was well attended and well worth attending, the A/V handling at the conference does still have room for improvement, as the videos linked above indicate. I've sent a few ideas to the organisers about reaching out to the PSF board for assistance and suggestions on that front. Hopefully they'll look into that a bit more for next year, as I think producing high quality talk recordings can act as excellent advertising for tech conferences in subsequent years, but doing that effectively requires a lot of preparation work both before and during the conference. There are some good resources for this now in the Python community at least in Australia and the US, so I'm hopeful that the PSF will be able to play a part in transferring that knowledge and experience to other parts of the world and we'll start seeing more and more Python conferences with recordings of a similar calibre to those from PyCon US and PyCon AU.<br></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Is Python's future currently at risk? (TLDR: No)</h3>
<br>Calvin Spealman recently <a href="http://www.ironfroggy.com/software/i-am-worried-about-the-future-of-python">posted his thoughts</a> on various aspects of where he sees computing in general heading, and his concerns about where Python may fit in that future.<br><br>I think his concerns are somewhat valid as far as specific market segments go, but I think they're overstating the case when it comes to "the future of Python", because I think his article takes a very narrow view of the computing field.<br><br>Smartphones and tablets are the new desktop (although the desktop won't go away, it will become limited to power users with demands for precision control and complex workflows). Python has long been relatively weak on the desktop when it comes to redistributing applications, due to the need to get the interpreter installed before it can be used. Microsoft's redistribution restrictions on their C runtime has made this all the more difficult when it comes to Windows. <br><br>We also made a fairly major misstep when we failed to appropriately advertise the addition of directory and zipfile execution support in Python 2.6 (bundle your code with all its dependencies except Python into a directory or zipfile and add a <span>__main__.py</span> file and the Python interpreter will execute it as if it was a script. With a zip file, you can even add a shebang line to the front and flag it it as executable and a POSIX shell will pass it to Python automatically if you run it directly. I haven't tried it, but the <span>py</span> launcher shipped with 3.3 should also handle such files). While we later went back and added the <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6#other-language-changes">appropriate notice</a> to the What's New in Python 2.6 documentation, and updated the <a href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#interface-options">command line guide</a> in the documentation, this capability still isn't widely known.<br><br>The complaints about dynamic language overhead on mobile devices  don't hold much water for me. Smartphones now are more powerful than  desktops were less than a decade ago, and Mozilla's Boot2Gecko project holds a lot of potential. While battery technology doesn't advance as fast as computing technology, Moore's Law is leveraged in the mobile space to allow more to be done with less power, reproducing the desktop (and server!) trajectories where dynamic languages were initially derided as too slow, until the hardware caught up to get them to the point of being "fast enough".<br><br>However, Python's real strengths have long been server side technology, software development by non-programmers and as an embedded scripting engine for trusted plugins (rather than those that need to be strictly isolated from, for example, a core game engine or the host OS). And in those areas, it's still powering ahead.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Widespread adoption requires being taken for granted</h3>Install a Linux distro. Which dynamic language interpreters are pre-installed? If you're using Debian or Fedora, it will be Python and Perl. The presence of those two can pretty much be taken for granted. Ruby probably won't be there, and a standalone Javascript interpreter certainly won't be.<br><br>Apple have expressed their support for Python by building tools that rely on it (with, as far as I know, Python being the only dynamic language interpreter shipped as part of Mac OS X. <i>Update: I'm told Apple ship Perl and Ruby as well</i>), and Microsoft ship their Python Tools for Visual Studio bundle. Google, of course, famously chose Python as the only dynamic language supported on their App Engine platform (and they currently employ Guido van Rossum and a number of other Python core developers).<br><br>gcc and gdb both let you write plugins, and your language choices are C/C++ or Python (plus Lisp in the gcc case). Many other infrastructure level tools are going the same way. Fedora's infrastructure is almost entirely written in Python, as is OpenStack.<br><br>If you're into multimedia development, Python will be a core part of your toolset, and Python is the key open source competitor to proprietary toolsets in the scientific community. The Natural Language Toolkit is a hugely powerful resource for many data mining applications, and Python is entwined deeply into the core of the financial sector as well.<br><br>Also, just as many years ago a lot of formal education program switched from C and C++ (or Pascal or Ada, etc) to Java for introductory programming courses, many are now switching to Python, pushing Java into the role of an enterprise language used only for large and complex applications where the development overhead can be justified to some degree. Businesses are getting to the point where they can choose Python as part of their technology base while being assured of a future pool of recruits that already know the language.<br><br>Informal education programs are also favouring Python as the first "real world" application language that people are introduced to. OLPC chose Python, as did RaspberryPI. Readability counts.<br><br>The Python Africa Tour has attracted quite a bit of interest, and I believe Africa plays host to its first PyCon later this year (in South Africa). Every other continent has now hosted multiple PyCon's each year in different countries and regions.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">Only one kind of client</h3>Things are substantially more competitive on the web service  front, with Rails and Django going head-to-head, and Node.js attempting to play the "you can use the same language on the frontend and the backend!" card.<br><br>As far as Node.js goes, I'm firmly convinced that if Node.js was going to be a hugely popular server side  framework, Twisted would have taken over the world by now. Callback  based programming is just plain <i>hard</i> for most humans to wrap  their heads around (often even harder than threaded programming) - hence  the popularity of <span>greenlets</span> and <span>gevent</span> in the Python world, which permit the use of asynchronous IO capabilities with a threading-like programming style. The  ongoing efforts around tweaking generator syntax and capabilities in Python core development could legitimately be summarised as "make it possible to write Twisted code in a way  that doesn't hurt people's brains quite so much and without relying on the magical stack-switching assembly code needed for greenlets".<br><br>In this space, Python's strength really lies in its ability to step away from traditional web technologies. Want to talk over a serial port to a piece of lab equipment or radio modem? Sure, we can do that. Want to talk to telco gear through a custom C extension? Sure, we have a wide range of tools to support that, too, along with some great Asterisk bindings. Python also has many web framework options, like Pyramid and Flask, that let you be more easily be selective in your choice of components than Django does.<br><br>This is important, because I just spent the past weekend here at PyCon India. While smartphones are popular amongst the largely urban professionals that make up the web development community and those they regularly associate with, they're still only available to a vanishingly small percentage of the global population. Much of the rest of the world doesn't even have access to a desktop computer let alone a smartphone. What they <i>do</i> have though are ordinary <i>mobile phones</i> (aka cellphones, for any Americans in the audience).<br><br>Added to that is the fact that the majority of the world's population is illiterate - they can understand spoken instructions, and are sufficiently numerate to press numbers on a keypad to operate an Interactive Voice Response System, but they won't be operating a smartphone any time soon, even if one was available to them.<br><br>The interfaces and language capabilities you need to reach *that* audience look nothing like those you can use to reach the smartphone toting crowd.<br><br>And that's before we even get into the potential long term implications of verbal and tactile interfaces like Siri and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjPFqkFyrOY">Baxter</a>.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: left;">No reason to relax</h3>All that said, while Python's future is looking very, very bright from where I sit, that's no reason to relax and assume that future is assured. Python is far from perfect, and the same can be said for the ecosystem around us.<br><br>Jacob's Sunday keynote at PyCon India spoke about the need for Python's web community to work on embracing the real time web, and lowering the barriers to entry to providing network-based realtime interactivity in Python-based web applications. It's likely any such efforts will require an update to the WSGI standards to support a streaming IO component, in addition to the current request/response model.<br><br>Tools like Kivy, that aim to make it easier to write mobile applications in Python are also an important part of extending Python's reach into areas where it is currently weak.<br><br>The recent 3.3 release included several elements aimed at making things easier for beginners (especially those on Windows), including improved error messages, an option to modify PATH in the Windows installer and the Python launcher, while the entire Python 3 series is aimed at embracing Unicode as part of the core of the language, allowing it to better reach beyond its original audience of users whose native alphabets could be expressed within the constraints of ASCII or an 8-bit encoding.<br><br>3.3 also took some of the first steps in improving the "out of the box" packaging dependency management experience, by integrating virtual environment support and namespace packages (along with making empty <span>__init__.py</span> files optional).<br><br>Concurrency is a problem where the overall Python ecosystem has many more options than those provided by the CPython interpreter implementation. We do offer plenty of interesting tools, especially for embarrassingly parallel problems that fit nicely into the concurrent.futures execution model. The GIL does cause problems for particular workloads, and switching to Jython or IronPython to take advantage of the free-threaded JVM and CLR implementations isn't always going to be an option. I've written <a href="http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html#but-but-surely-fixing-the-gil-is-more-important-than-fixing-unicode">far more extensively</a> on that topic, though, so I won't repeat that here.<br><br>We should also look at ways of making it easier for other languages  to interoperate with Python without an intervening C interface. Perhaps  Python should ship a <span>pycall</span> script like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/misc/src/default/pycall">this one</a>,  that makes it easy to invoke Python functions directly in a pipeline or  from another application (passing JSON data in via stdin, and receiving  JSON data back via stdout). Conversely, better shell integration is always worth exploring.<br><br>And, of course, our journey in rebuilding the Unicode infrastructure is ongoing. Python 3.4 is likely to bring improvements in the ability to switch the encoding of a stream "mid-flight", as well as restoring some convenience APIs for the non-Unicode related uses of the encoding and decoding methods in Python 2.<br><br>So yes, there are plenty of areas where Python can, and should, and probably will, improve. But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that many of the problems with Python (like binary distribution, dependency management and concurrency) are problems with software development generally, so there's nowhere for people to go that will magically make those issues disappear (or else they come at the price of losing out on many of Python's other advantages, or committing to a particular platform, or some other downside).<br><br>We're a conservative community by nature - we generally <i>don't like</i> blazing trails when it comes to language design. Instead, we're happy to let others rush ahead, letting them figure out where the pitfalls are, while we see what we can learn from their experience and integrate into Python's syntax, standard libraries, or the Python Package Index.</div>
