&lt;p&gt;Just one small problem: the bulk of the storage on that drive was in a TrueCrypt encrypted file, and the Dolphin file browser in KDE doesn't support mounting those as volumes through the GUI (at least, it doesn't as far as I could see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, off to the command line we go. While TrueCrypt itself isn't readily available for Fedora due to problems with its licensing terms, the standard &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup&lt;/code&gt; utility supports accessing existing TrueCrypt volumes, and the &lt;code&gt;tcplay&lt;/code&gt; package also supports creation of new volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I just wanted to read the music files, so it turns out that &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup&lt;/code&gt; was all I needed, but I didn't figure that out until after I'd already installed &lt;code&gt;tcplay&lt;/code&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tcplay&lt;/code&gt;, one of the things you need to set up in order to access a TrueCrypt encrypted &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to a fully encrypted volume) is a loopback device - these let you map a filesystem block device back to a file living on another filesystem. The examples in the &lt;code&gt;tcplay&lt;/code&gt; manual page (&lt;code&gt;man tcplay&lt;/code&gt;) indicated the command I needed to set that up was &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt; instructions gave me trouble, as they appeared to be telling me I didn't have any loopback devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[ncoghlan@thechalk ~]$ losetup -f &amp;amp;lt;path to encrypted file&amp;amp;gt;
losetup: cannot find an unused loop device: No such file or directory
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Searching on Google for "fedora create a loop device" brought me to &lt;a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/98742/how-to-add-more-dev-loop-devices-on-fedora-19"&gt;this Unix &amp;amp; Linux Stack Exchange question&lt;/a&gt; as the first result, but the answer there struck me as being far too low level to be reasonable as a prerequisite for accessing encrypted files as volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I scanned further down through the list of search results, with &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019440"&gt;this Fedora bug report&lt;/a&gt; about difficulty accessing TrueCrypt volumes catching my eye. As with the Stack Overflow answer, most of the comments there seemed to be about reverting the effect of &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=896160"&gt;a change to Fedora's default behaviour&lt;/a&gt; a change which meant that Fedora no longer came with any loop devices preconfigured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, looking more closely at Kay's original request to trim back the list of default devices revealed an interesting statement: "Loop devices can and should be created on-demand, and only when needed, losetup has been updated since Fedora 17 to do that just fine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn't match my own experience with the &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt; command, so I wondered what might be going on to explain the discrepancy, which is when it occurred to me that running &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt; with root access might solve the problem. Generally speaking, ordinary users aren't going to have the permissions needed to create new devices, and I'd been running the &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt; command using my normal user permissions rather than running it as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. That was a fairly straightforward theory to test, and sure enough, that worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[ncoghlan@thechalk ~]$ sudo losetup -f &amp;amp;lt;path to encrypted file&amp;amp;gt;
/dev/loop0
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Armed with my new loop device, I was then able to open the TrueCrypt encrypted file on the external GoFlex drive as a decrypted volume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[ncoghlan@thechalk ~]$ sudo cryptsetup open --type tcrypt /dev/loop0 flexdecrypted
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Actually supplying the password to decrypt the volume wasn't a problem, as I use a password manager to limit the number of passwords I need to actually &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt;, while still being able to use strong passwords for different services and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even with my music files in the process of copying over to my laptop, this all still seemed a bit cryptic to me, even for the Linux command line. It would have saved me a lot of time if I'd been nudged in the direction of "sudo losetup -f" much sooner, rather than having to decide to ignore some bad advice I found on the internet and instead figure out a better answer by way of the Fedora issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took four additional steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I filed &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215370"&gt;a new issue&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt;, suggesting that it nudge the user in the direction of running it with root privileges if they first run it as a normal user and don't find any devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, I followed up on the previous issue I had found in order to &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019440#c22"&gt;explain my findings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, I added a &lt;a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/198637/61794"&gt;new answer&lt;/a&gt; to the Stack Exchange question I had found, suggesting the use of the higher level &lt;code&gt;losetup&lt;/code&gt; command over the lower level &lt;code&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I wrote this post recounting the tale of figuring this out from a combination of local system manual pages and online searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a right-click option to Dolphin to be able to automatically mount TrueCrypt encrypted files as volumes and open them would be an even nicer solution, but also a whole lot more work. The only actual &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; suggested in my above set of additional steps is tweaking a particular error message in one particular situation, which should be far more attainable than a new Dolphin feature or addon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fedora</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2015/04/fedora-encrypted-volumes.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 22:24:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
