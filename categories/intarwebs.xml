Management had let a non-software developer select the original "source control tool" and they had picked something that required custom scripting just to do a baseline (I wish I was kidding).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So a bunch of candidate replacements were put forward for consideration, and CVS won because it was free, thus there would be fewer arguments with management about rolling it out on a project that was already over budget and behind schedule. (The fact that Subversion wasn't considered as a candidate should give you some additional hints about the precise timing of this - Subversion 1.0 was released in February 2004. Yes, for those that are new to this game, you read that right: it is only within the last decade that the majority of the open source VCS world began to enjoy the benefits of atomic commits).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other interesting aspects of that system included the fact that one of the developers on that project basically had to write a custom xUnit testing system from scratch in order to start putting together a decent automated test suite for the system, there was no code review tool, and you couldn't include direct links to bug tracker items in emails or anything else - you had to reference them by name or number, and people would then look those names or numbers up in the dedicated bug tracking application client.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High level design documentation, if it existed at all, was in the form of Microsoft Word documents. Low level API documentation? Yes, that would have been nice (there were some attempts to generate something vaguely readable with Doxygen but, yeah, well, C++).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Less than ten years later, though, and there are signs our industry is starting to grow up (although I expect many enterprise shops are still paying extortionate rates to the likes of IBM for the "Rational" suite of tools only to gain a significantly inferior development experience):&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can get genuinely high quality code hosting for free. Sure &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/"&gt;Sourceforge&lt;/a&gt; was already around back then, but Git and Mercurial stomp all over CVS from a collaboration point of view. These also come with decent issue trackers and various other collaboration tools. If you don't want to trust a service provider with your code, than tools like &lt;a href="http://gitlabhq.com/"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; let you set up similar environments internally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web based issue trackers are everywhere, with the ubiquitous "issue URL" allowing effective cross-linking between tracker issues, documentation, code comments, source control browsers, code review systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dedicated code review tools like &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/"&gt;Gerrit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/rietveld/"&gt;Reitveld&lt;/a&gt; are published as open source (and, in the case of the latter, even available as a free service on &lt;a href="http://codereview.appspot.com/"&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services like &lt;a href="http://readthedocs.org/"&gt;ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt; exist, allowing you to easily build and publish high quality documentation. All with nice URLs so you can link it from emails, tracker issues, source code, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organisations like &lt;a href="https://www.shiningpanda.com/"&gt;Shining Panda CI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; provide hosted continuous integration services that put the internal capabilities of many large companies to shame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language communities provide cross-platform distribution services to reach a global audience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depending on the language you use, you may even have tools like &lt;a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/"&gt;SonarSource&lt;/a&gt; available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you go into production in the web application world, service components like &lt;a href="https://www.getsentry.com/welcome/"&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/faq"&gt;Graphite&lt;/a&gt; are again available for no charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And to access all this good stuff for free? All you have to do is be willing to share your work (and sometimes not even that). If you don't want to share your work, then the service providers generally have very reasonable fees - you could probably put together a state of the art suite of tools for less than a few hundred bucks a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take my own hobby projects as an example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;they're hosted on &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt; as Mercurial projects (I happen to prefer Mercurial, although I can definitely see why people like Git, too). That gives me integrated issue tracking and online source code browsing, too. (OK, so I could have had essentially that back in the early SourceForge days, but the UI aspects have improved in many respects in the intervening years)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can publish my projects on the &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/"&gt;Python Package Index&lt;/a&gt; with a simple "&lt;span&gt;setup.py sdist upload&lt;/span&gt;". They're then available for anyone in the world to install with a straightforward command like "&lt;span&gt;pip install walkdir&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ncoghlan-devs-projects/"&gt;Shining Panda CI&lt;/a&gt;, I know the downloads from PyPI work, and I also know that the projects work on all the versions and implementations of Python I want to support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="http://readthedocs.org/profiles/ncoghlan/"&gt;ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;, you can read nicely formatted documentation like &lt;a href="http://walkdir.readthedocs.org/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; rather than trying to decipher plain text files or wiki pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm living in the future and it is seriously &lt;i&gt;cool&lt;/i&gt; (and that's just looking at things purely from a software development infrastructure point of view - the rise of "Infrastructure as a Service" and "Platform as a Service" providers, including Red Hat's own &lt;a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/"&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, has massive implications on the deployment side of things, and there's of course the implications of the many open source wheels that don't need to be reinvented)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best part from my point of view is that these days I get to work for a &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; that already genuinely understands the long term significance of the power of collaborative development. It also doesn't hurt that there's still a lot of money to be made in helping the rest of the enterprise world come to grips with that reality :)</description><category>intarwebs</category><category>python</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2012/05/embarrassment-of-riches.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2012 14:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Using the SOPA protests to highlight related problems in Australia</title><link>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2012/01/using-sopa-protests-to-highlight.html</link><dc:creator>Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I  figure this is the easiest place to publish the message I just sent to  Larissa Waters, the Greens Senator that is one of Queensland's  representatives in the Federal Senate. I also wrote to Yvette D'ath (our  local MHR) a few days ago, but I didn't keep a copy of that one. Will  this achieve anything? Probably not, but hey, at least I tried (and if  none of their constituents ever write to them about it, our reps are  quite entitled to assume we're all OK with them selling out the county  to legacy US media interests): &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Senator Waters,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With  today being the day Wikipedia and a wide range of other sites have  either gone dark or taken other action to protest draconian internet  censorship legislation making its way through the US Congress, it seems  an opportune time to highlight our own government's ongoing concerning  behaviour on that front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of particular concern is their &lt;a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2012/01/17/govt-censors-secret-anti-piracy-meeting-notes/"&gt;continuing refusal&lt;/a&gt; to release details of a secretive meeting between government  representatives and representatives of the same organisations that are  behind the draconian US bills currently being protested. The government  even &lt;a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/12/23/secret-piracy-talks-govt-banned-consumer-groups/"&gt;deliberately excluded&lt;/a&gt; representatives of a number of community interest organisations that sought to attend these discussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These  legacy media companies (aka horse drawn carriage manufacturers) are  flailing around wildly as the rise of free and open digital  communications networks (aka automobiles) threatens the cherished  gatekeeper role they have enjoyed for the past few decades as media  distributors. They have failed to adapt, and are increasingly being  bypassed as artists, writers, musicians, comedians and other media  creators find ways to use the power of the internet to connect more  directly with their fans. These direct connections are great for both  artists and fans, but place the intermediaries like YouTube, Apple  iTunes, Amazon, BandCamp, Flickr, etc, in the role of service providers  to the artists and fans rather than gatekeepers to widespread  distribution. Unfortunately, instead of going gracefully into that good  night, these organisations are investing inordinate sums of money  worldwide in lobbying for legislation that would make the permissive,  open practices of most of these new service providers a recipe for  prohibitively high legal liabilities, effectively making those practices  unsustainable and thus breaking the internet as we know it today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Australia  already markedly shifted many intellectual monopoly policies to favour  the interests of US copyright holders at the expense of Australian  citizens when we signed the US-FTA some time ago. We have also  participated in the secretive process of drafting the  Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which spends far more time  considering digital copyright infringement than it does actual  counterfeiting. The current negotiations over membership in the  Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement raise legitimate fears that  Australia's intellectual monopoly policy will be shifted even further  towards the draconian position of the United State Trade Representative,  even as those policies are being protested strongly within the US  itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In line with your &lt;a href="http://greens.org.au/policies/human-rights-democracy/community-participation-in-government"&gt;published policy&lt;/a&gt; on community participation in government, do the Greens plan to  publicly question the government over their apparent willingness to  place the interest of large US companies ahead of those of individual  Australian citizens?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;Nick.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><category>intarwebs</category><category>politics</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2012/01/using-sopa-protests-to-highlight.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 09:47:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ego Surfing</title><link>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2006/04/ego-surfing.html</link><dc:creator>Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So, one of Techdirt's latest stories led me back to &lt;a href="http://www.canton.elegal.ca/archives/2006/02/internet_privac.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about the perils of putting too much personal info on line. Possibly even things like having the words "boredom" and "laziness" as part of a domain name you own, and then not updating the associated website for months on end, so people googling your name can wonder about your follow-through when it comes to keeping up with projects you start*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, as a result I did a bit of googling of my own. It used to be that Google gave me &lt;a href="https://www.curiousefficiency.org/2004/12/google-footprint.html"&gt; far more prominence&lt;/a&gt; than one might expect, with buckets of references to python-list and python-dev posts. When I noticed those posts weren't on the first list of results anymore, and links for both the actor and the surfer were now included, I thought Google might have done something to give the non-mailing list results more importance, and give a result that better reflected mainstream celebrity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A closer look though and I find that while the list of sites has changed, my original opinion still holds: even with a lot more mainstream media moving online, your Google footprint still says far more about your online presence than your fame (or lack thereof) in the offline world. And I still manage to find that fact both obvious and intriguing at the same time :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*(FWIW, most of the stuff I write online is Python related, and ends up on the Python mailing lists rather than here)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>intarwebs</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2006/04/ego-surfing.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2006 15:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Self-defeating Advertisements</title><link>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2005/04/self-defeating-advertisements.html</link><dc:creator>Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My main web browser is Mozilla Firefox. It has this lovely little extension called AdBlock, which let's me eliminate irritating content from the web pages I view. So what does that have to do with the title of the article?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simple: A lot of the time, I &lt;i&gt;do not switch AdBlock on&lt;/i&gt;. Normal banner ads, that generally stay out of my way, just plain don't bother me that much. I'm happy to let them appear on the screen (even if I don't click on them). As soon as an ad starts intruding on my web experience, though, out comes AdBlock, so I can say "Leave me the hell alone, you rude, pushy mongrels". Some ads get my attention without triggering that reflex (Absolut and IBM come to mind), because they don't block the main text, and are genuinely entertaining. Other ads (especially ones that interfere with real content) discover that getting too much of my attention can be a bad thing - it raises the irritation level enough to get me to take action. And, thanks to AdBlock's address wildcards, that will mean far more than just the one ad that triggered the block will be eliminated from my web surfing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>intarwebs</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2005/04/self-defeating-advertisements.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2005 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Google Footprint</title><link>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2004/12/google-footprint.html</link><dc:creator>Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so here's the thing. In the real world, most Australians talking about 'Nick Coghlan' are going to be talking about the guy on Secret Life of Us. If not him, then the surfer from somewhere down south. If we went to Canada, well, there's a diplomat by that name, so at least a few people would know who he is, or would have seen an article or two about him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter the world of Google, though, and an awful lot of it is about me. On the first two pages of a search for "Nick Coghlan", there's just one entry halfway down the second page for the Canadian guy. The other two don't show up until the third page. The results are skewed massively in my favour because of the public mailing list web archives that Google indexes - and every one of my messages to those lists includes my name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can really see the effect of this by searching for "Nicholas Coghlan" instead. I disappear from the results, and the TV actor and the Canadian diplomat take control of the show. I don't show up until page 4, on an old announcement from UQ. As you might guess from that, I don't use my full first name very often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another interesting search is "nick coghlan -python -cygwin -software". The results are then quite similar to the "nicholas coghlan" results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I guess my only real observation is that, when searching just for names, Google gives extremely high weight to participation in public online communities. Obvious, one might say, but it's an interesting limitation when looking for information on more famous people that happen to share a name with someone like me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>intarwebs</category><guid>https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2004/12/google-footprint.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2004 11:14:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
