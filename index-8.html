</div>
            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>I recently got a new ultrabook (a HP Spectre 360), which means I finally have enough space to transfer my music files from the external drive where they've been stored for the past few years back to the laptop (there really wasn't enough space for them on my previous laptop, a first generation ASUS Zenbook, but even with the Windows partition still around, the extra storage space on the new device leaves plenty of room for my music collection).</p>
<p>Just one small problem: the bulk of the storage on that drive was in a TrueCrypt encrypted file, and the Dolphin file browser in KDE doesn't support mounting those as volumes through the GUI (at least, it doesn't as far as I could see).</p>
<p>So, off to the command line we go. While TrueCrypt itself isn't readily available for Fedora due to problems with its licensing terms, the standard <code>cryptsetup</code> utility supports accessing existing TrueCrypt volumes, and the <code>tcplay</code> package also supports creation of new volumes.</p>
<p>In my case, I just wanted to read the music files, so it turns out that <code>cryptsetup</code> was all I needed, but I didn't figure that out until after I'd already installed <code>tcplay</code> as well.</p>
<p>For both <code>cryptsetup</code> and <code>tcplay</code>, one of the things you need to set up in order to access a TrueCrypt encrypted <em>file</em> (as opposed to a fully encrypted volume) is a loopback device - these let you map a filesystem block device back to a file living on another filesystem. The examples in the <code>tcplay</code> manual page (<code>man tcplay</code>) indicated the command I needed to set that up was <code>losetup</code>.</p>
<p>However, the <code>losetup</code> instructions gave me trouble, as they appeared to be telling me I didn't have any loopback devices:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">ncoghlan@thechalk ~</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">losetup</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">encrypted</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="nl">losetup</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cannot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">find</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">an</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">loop</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">device</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">No</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">such</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">or</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">directory</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Searching on Google for "fedora create a loop device" brought me to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/98742/how-to-add-more-dev-loop-devices-on-fedora-19">this Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange question</a> as the first result, but the answer there struck me as being far too low level to be reasonable as a prerequisite for accessing encrypted files as volumes.</p>
<p>So I scanned further down through the list of search results, with <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019440">this Fedora bug report</a> about difficulty accessing TrueCrypt volumes catching my eye. As with the Stack Overflow answer, most of the comments there seemed to be about reverting the effect of <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=896160">a change to Fedora's default behaviour</a> a change which meant that Fedora no longer came with any loop devices preconfigured.</p>
<p>However, looking more closely at Kay's original request to trim back the list of default devices revealed an interesting statement: "Loop devices can and should be created on-demand, and only when needed, losetup has been updated since Fedora 17 to do that just fine."</p>
<p>That didn't match my own experience with the <code>losetup</code> command, so I wondered what might be going on to explain the discrepancy, which is when it occurred to me that running <code>losetup</code> with root access might solve the problem. Generally speaking, ordinary users aren't going to have the permissions needed to create new devices, and I'd been running the <code>losetup</code> command using my normal user permissions rather than running it as <code>root</code>. That was a fairly straightforward theory to test, and sure enough, that worked:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">ncoghlan@thechalk ~</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sudo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">losetup</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">encrypted</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">loop0</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Armed with my new loop device, I was then able to open the TrueCrypt encrypted file on the external GoFlex drive as a decrypted volume:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">ncoghlan</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="nx">thechalk</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">~</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sudo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">cryptsetup</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">open</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="k">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">tcrypt</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">loop0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">flexdecrypted</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Actually supplying the password to decrypt the volume wasn't a problem, as I use a password manager to limit the number of passwords I need to actually <em>remember</em>, while still being able to use strong passwords for different services and devices.</p>
<p>However, even with my music files in the process of copying over to my laptop, this all still seemed a bit cryptic to me, even for the Linux command line. It would have saved me a lot of time if I'd been nudged in the direction of "sudo losetup -f" much sooner, rather than having to decide to ignore some bad advice I found on the internet and instead figure out a better answer by way of the Fedora issue tracker.</p>
<p>So I took four additional steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215370">a new issue</a> against <code>losetup</code>, suggesting that it nudge the user in the direction of running it with root privileges if they first run it as a normal user and don't find any devices</li>
<li>Secondly, I followed up on the previous issue I had found in order to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019440#c22">explain my findings</a>
</li>
<li>Thirdly, I added a <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/198637/61794">new answer</a> to the Stack Exchange question I had found, suggesting the use of the higher level <code>losetup</code> command over the lower level <code>mknod</code> command</li>
<li>Finally, I wrote this post recounting the tale of figuring this out from a combination of local system manual pages and online searches</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a right-click option to Dolphin to be able to automatically mount TrueCrypt encrypted files as volumes and open them would be an even nicer solution, but also a whole lot more work. The only actual <em>change</em> suggested in my above set of additional steps is tweaking a particular error message in one particular situation, which should be far more attainable than a new Dolphin feature or addon.</p>

                    <p>(Note: I'm speaking with my "CPython core developer" hat on in this article,
rather than my "Red Hat employee" one, although it's the latter role that
gave me broad visibility into the Fedora/RHEL/CentOS Python ecosystem)</p>
<p>Alex Gaynor recently raised some
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2015/mar/30/red-hat-open-source-community/">significant concerns</a>
in relation to his perception that Red Hat expects the upstream community
to support our long term support releases for as long as we do, only without
getting paid for it.</p>
<p>That's not true, so I'm going to say it explicitly: if you're currently
supporting Python 2.6 for free because folks using RHEL 6 or one of its
derivatives say they need it, and this is proving to be a hassle for you,
then stop. If they complain, then point them at this post, as providing an
easily linkable reference for that purpose is one of the main reasons I'm
writing it. If they still don't like it, then you may want to further suggest
that they come argue with me about it, and leave you alone.</p>
<p>The affected users have more options than they may realise, and upstream
open source developers shouldn't feel obliged to donate their own time to
help end users cope with organisations that aren't yet able to upgrade their
internal infrastructure in a more timely fashion.</p>
<h2>Red Hat Supported Python Upgrade Paths</h2>
<p>Since <a href="https://developerblog.redhat.com/2013/09/12/rhscl1-ga/">September 2013</a>,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions have included access to an additional
component called
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/1/html/1.2_Release_Notes/chap-RHSCL.html#sect-RHSCL-About">Red Hat Software Collections</a>. You can think of Software Collections roughly
as "virtualenv for the system package manager", providing access to newer
language runtimes (including Python 2.7 and 3.3), database runtimes, and
web server runtimes, all without interfering with the versions of those
integrated with (and used by) the operating system layer itself.</p>
<p>This model (and the fact they're included with the base Red Hat Enterprise
Linux subscription) means that Red Hat subscribers are able to install
and use these newer runtimes without needing to upgrade the entire operating
system.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/06/10/red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-now-generally-available/">June 2014</a>,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 has also been available, including an upgrade of
the system Python to Python 2.7. The latest release of that is
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-continues-platform-innovation-general-availability-first-minor-release-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1</a>.</p>
<p>As Red Hat subscriptions all include free upgrades to new releases, the main
barrier to deployment of these newer Python releases is
<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrkosar/status/583786245261754368">institutional inertia</a>.
While it's entirely admirable that many upstream developers are generous
enough to help their end users work around this inertia, in the long run
doing so is detrimental for everyone concerned, as long term sustaining
engineering for old releases is genuinely demotivating for upstream
developers (it's a good job, but a lousy way to spend your free time), and
for end users, working around institutional inertia this way reduces the
pressure to actually get the situation addressed properly.</p>
<p>Beyond Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat's portfolio also includes
both the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> Platform-as-a-Service
offering and the <a href="https://www.feedhenry.com/">Feed Henry</a> Mobile Application
Platform. For many organisations looking to adopt an iterative approach to
web service development, those are going to be a better fit than deploying
directly to Red Hat Enterprise Linux and building a custom web service
management system around that.</p>
<h2>Third Party Supported Python Upgrade Paths</h2>
<p>The current Red Hat supported upgrade paths require administrative access to
a system. While it's aimed primarily at scientific users, the comprehensive
<a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda Python distribution</a>
from Continuum Analytics is a good way to obtain prebuilt versions of Python
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux that can be installed by individual users
without administrative access.</p>
<p>At Strata 2015, Continuum's Python distribution not only featured in a
combined announcement regarding on-premise deployment of <a href="https://redhatstorage.redhat.com/2015/02/17/deploying-pyspark-on-red-hat-storage-glusterfs/">Anaconda Cluster
together with Red Hat Storage</a>,
but also in Microsoft's announcement of Python support in the
<a href="https://continuum.io/blog/azureml">Azure Machine Learning service</a></p>
<p>For users that don't need a full scientific Python distribution, Continuum
Analytics also offer <a href="https://continuum.io/downloads">miniconda</a> which just
provides a Python runtime and the conda package manager, providing end users
with a cross-platform way to obtain and manage multiple Python runtimes
without needing administrative access to their systems.</p>
<h2>Community Supported Python Upgrade Paths</h2>
<p>The question of providing upgrade paths for folks without an active Red Hat
subscription has also been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-and-centos-join-forces">January 2014</a>
Red Hat became an official sponsor of the long established CentOS project,
with the aim of providing a stable base for community open source innovation
above the operating system layer (this aim contrasts with the aims of the
Fedora project, which is intended primarily to drive innovation within the
operating system layer itself).</p>
<p>CentOS 7 was originally released in
<a href="https://seven.centos.org/2014/07/release-announcement-for-centos-7x86_64/">July 2014</a>,
and the latest release, CentOS 7(1503), was just published (as the name
suggests) in
<a href="https://seven.centos.org/2015/03/centos-7-1503-is-released/">March 2015</a>).</p>
<p>For CentOS and other RHEL derivatives, the upstream project for Red Hat
Software Collections is hosted at
<a href="https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/">softwarecollections.org</a>, making
these collections available to the whole Fedora/RHEL/CentOS ecosystem, rather
than only being available to Red Hat subscribers.</p>
<p>Folks running Fedora Rawhide that are particularly keen to be on the cutting
edge of Python can even obtain prerelease Python 3.5 nightly builds as a
software collection from Miro Hrončok's
<a href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/churchyard/python3-nightly/">Fedora COPR repository</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining Fedora itself, the Fedora community also maintains
the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux</a>
(EPEL) repositories, providing ready access to non-conflicting packages
beyond those in the set included in the base Red Hat Enterprise Linx and
CentOS releases.</p>
<h2>Providing Commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux Support</h2>
<p>If projects are regularly receiving requests for support on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and derived platforms, and the developers involved are actively looking
to build a sustainable business around their software, then a steady stream
of these requests may represent an opportunity worth exploring. After all,
Red Hat's subscribers all appreciate the value that deploying commercially
supported open source software can bring to an organisation, and are
necessarily familiar with the use of software subscriptions to support
sustaining engineering and the ongoing development of new features for the
open source software that they deploy.</p>
<p>One of the key things that many customers are looking for is pre-release
integration testing to provide some level of assurance that the software
they deploy will work in their environment, while another is a secure
development and distribution pipeline that ensures that the software they
install is coming from organisations that they trust.</p>
<p>One of Red Hat's essential tools for managing this distributed integration
testing and content assurance effort is its
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/partners">Partner Program</a>. This program is
designed to not only assist Red Hat subscribers in finding supported
software that meets their needs, but also to provide Red Hat, partners, and
customers with confidence that the components of deployed solutions will
work well together in target deployment environments.</p>
<p>Specifically for web service developers that would like to provide a
supported on-premise offering, last year's announcement of a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-announces-certification-for-containerized-applications-extends-customer-confidence-and-trust-to-the-cloud">Container Certification Program</a>
(with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and the OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service
offering as certified container hosts) extended Red Hat's certification
programs to cover the certification of Docker containers in addition to
other forms of Linux application deployment.</p>
<p>Even more recently, the
<a href="https://connect.redhat.com/zones/containers">Red Hat Container Development Kit</a>
was introduced to help streamline that certification process for Red Hat
Independent Software Vendor Partners.</p>
<p>But these are all things that folks should only explore if they're
specifically interested in building a commercial support business around
their software. If users are trying to get long term maintenance support
for a community project for free, then upstream developers should be sending
a single unified message in response: don't assume you'll be able to run
new versions of open source software on old platforms unless you're
specifically paying someone to ensure that happens.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this because I work for a platform vendor that gets paid (at
least in part) to do this, I'm saying it because most open source projects
are maintained by innovators that are upgrading their technology stacks
regularly, where versions of components are already old after 2 years and
truly ancient after 5. Expecting open source innovators to provide long term
maintenance for free is simply unreasonable - regularly upgrading their own
stacks means they don't need this long term platform support for themselves,
so the folks that are seeking it should be expected to pay for it to happen.
(Apparent exceptions like CentOS aren't exceptions at all: sustaining
engineering on CentOS is instead a beneficial community byproduct of the
<a href="https://crunchtools.com/deep-dive-rebase-vs-backport/">paid sustaining engineering</a>
that goes into Red Hat Enterprise Linux).</p>

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>As reported in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/linus-torvalds-on-why-he-isnt-nice-i-dont-care-about-you/">Ars Technica</a>,
the ongoing efforts to promote diversity in open source communities came
up once more during the plenary Q&amp;A session with Linus Torvalds, Andrew Tridgell,
Bdale Garbee and Rusty Russell.</p>
<p>I was there for that session, and found that Linus's response appeared to
betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the motives of many of the folks
pushing for increased diversity in the open source community, as well as a
lack of awareness of the terrible situations that can arise when leaders in a
community regularly demonstrate abusive behaviour without suffering any
significant consequences (just ask folks like Kathy Sierra, Zoe Quinn, Anita
Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu that have been subjected to sustained campaigns of
harassment largely for being women that dared to have and express an opinion
on the internet).</p>
<p>As the coordinator of the Python Software Foundation's contribution to the
linux.conf.au 2015 financial assistance program, and as someone with a deep
personal interest in the overall success of the open source community, I feel
it is important for me to state explicitly that I consider Linus's level of
ignorance around appropriate standards of community conduct to be unacceptable
in an open source community leader in 2015.</p>
<p>Linus's defence of his abusive behaviour is that he's "not nice", and
"doesn't care about you". He does care deeply about his project, though,
and claims to be motivated primarily by wanting that to continue to be
successful.</p>
<p>To be completely honest, the momentum behind the Linux juggernaut is now
large enough that Linus could likely decide to chuck it all in and spend the
rest of his life on a beach sipping cocktails without worrying about open
source politics, and people would figure out a way to ensure that Linux
continued to thrive and grow without him. Many a successful start-up has made
that transition when the founders leave, and there's no good reason to believe
an open source community would be fundamentally different in that regard. The
transition to a new leadership structure might be a little messy, but the
community would almost certainly figure it out.</p>
<p>However, there's still a lot of scope for Linus to influence <em>how fast</em> Linux
grows, and on that front his words and actions suggest that he considers
being careless in his speech, without regard for the collateral damage
his verbal broadsides may be doing to his cause, more important than
having the most positive impact he is capable of having on the future growth
of the Linux kernel development project and the open source community at
large.</p>
<h2>It's not (necessarily) about being nice</h2>
<p>It may surprise some folks to learn that I don't consider myself a nice human
either. My temper is formidable (I just keep it under control most of the
time, a task online communication makes easier by providing the ability to
walk away from the computer for a while), and any feelings of compassion I
have for others are more a product of years of deliberate practice and
hanging around with compassionate people than they are any particularly
strong innate knack for empathy.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that genuinely nice people do exist, and I assume
that one of their key motives for creating open, welcoming, inclusive
communities is because it's fundamentally the right thing to do. The main
reason I exclude myself from my assumed category of "nice people" is that,
while I acknowledge that motivation intellectually, it's not really one that
I feel viscerally.</p>
<p>Instead, what I do care about, passionately, is <em>helping the best ideas win</em>
(where I include "feasible" as part of my definition of "best"). Not the
"best ideas from people willing to tolerate extensive personal abuse".
The best ideas anyone is willing to share with me, period. And I won't hear
those ideas unless I help create environments where all participants are
willing to speak up, not just those that are prepared to accept a blistering
verbal barrage from a powerful authority figure as a possible consequence of
attempting to participate. Those are upsetting enough when they come from
random strangers on the internet, when they come from someone with enormous
influence not only over you and your future career, but also your entire
industry, they can be devastating.</p>
<h2>The second order consequences</h2>
<p>So there you have it, my not-nice reason for advocating for more welcoming and
inclusive open source communities: because, from an engineering standpoint, I
consider "has a high level of tolerance for receiving personal abuse from
community leaders" to be an extraordinarily stupid filter to apply to your
pool of potential contributors.</p>
<p>Exhibiting abusive behaviour as a leader has additional consequences though,
and they can be even more problematic: by regularly demonstrating abusive
behaviour yourself, you end up normalising harassment within your community
in general, both in public and in private.</p>
<p>I believe Linus when he says he doesn't care about who people are or where
they're from, only their contributions. I'm the same way - until I've known
them for a while, I tend to care about contributors and potential
contributors wholesale (i.e. happy people that enjoy the environment
they're participating in tend to spend more time engaged, learn faster,
produce superior contributions, and more quickly reach the point of being
able to contribute independently), rather than retail (i.e. I care about my
friends because they're my friends, regardless of context).</p>
<p>But when you're personally abusive as a leader, you also have to take a high
level of responsibility for all the folks that look up to you as a role
model, and act out the same behaviours you exhibit in public. When you reach
this point, the preconditions for participation in your community now include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Willing to tolerate public personal abuse from project leaders</li>
<li>Willing to tolerate public personal abuse from the community at large</li>
<li>Willing to tolerate personal abuse in private</li>
</ul>
<p>With clauses like that as part of the definition, the claim of "meritocracy"
starts to feel a little shaky, doesn't it? Meritocracy is a fine ideal
to strive for, but claiming to have achieved it when you're imposing
irrelevant requirements like this is arrogant nonsense.</p>
<p>We're not done yet, though, as this culture of abuse then combines with
elitism based on previously acquired knowledge to make it normal to <em>abuse
newcomers for still being in the process of learning</em>. I find it hard to
conceive of a more effective approach to keeping people from adopting
something you're giving away for free than tolerating a community that
publicly abuses people for not magically already knowing how to use
technology that they may have never even heard of before.</p>
<p>As a result of this perspective, the only time I'll endeavour to eject anyone
from a community where I have significant influence is when they're actively
creating an unpleasant environment for other participants, and demonstrate no
remorse whatsoever regarding the negative impact their actions are having on
the overall collaborative effort. I count myself incredibly fortunate to
have only had to do this a few times in my life so far, but it's something
I believe in strongly enough for it to have been the basis for once deciding
to resign from a position paying a six-figure salary at a company I otherwise
loved working for. To that company's credit, the abusive leader was let go
not long afterwards, but the whole secretive corporate system is rigged such
that these toxic "leaders" can usually quickly find new positions elsewhere
and hence new subordinates to make miserable - the fact that I'm not willing
to name names here for fear of the professional consequences is just one more
example of how the system is largely set up to protect abusive leaders rather
than holding them to account for the impact their actions have on others.</p>
<h2>Ideas and code are still fair game</h2>
<p>One of the spurious fears raised against the apparently radical notion of
refusing to tolerate personal abuse in a collaborative environment is that
adopting civil communication practices somehow means that bad <em>code</em> must
then be accepted into the project.</p>
<p>Eliminating personal abuse doesn't mean eliminating rigorous critique of
code and ideas. It just means making sure that you <em>are</em> critiquing the
code and the ideas, rather than tearing down the person contributing them.
It's the difference between "This code isn't any good, here are the problems
with it, I'm confident you can do better on your next attempt" (last part
optional but usually beneficial when it comes to growing your contributor
community) and "This code is terrible, how dare you befoul my presence with
it, begone from my sight, worm!".</p>
<p>The latter response may be a funny joke if done in private between close
friends, but when it's done in public, in front of a large number of
onlookers who don't know either the sender or the recipient personally, it
sets an astoundingly bad example as to what a mutually beneficial
collaborative peer relationship should look like.</p>
<p>And if you don't have the self-discipline needed to cope with the changing
context of our online interactions in the open source community? Well,
perhaps you don't yet have the temperament needed to be an open source leader
on an internet that is no longer the sole preserve of those of us that are
more interested in computers than we are in people. Most of the technical and
business press have yet to figure out that they can actually do a bit of
investigative journalism to see how well vendor rhetoric aligns with upstream
open source engineering activity (frequency of publication is still a far
more important performance metric for most journalists than questioning the
spin served up in corporate press releases), so the number of folks peering
into the open source development fishbowl is only going to grow over time.</p>
<p>It isn't <em>that</em> hard to learn the necessary self-control, though. It's mostly
just a matter of taking the time to read each email or code review comment,
look for the parts that are about the contributor rather than the code or the
design, and <em>remove them before hitting send</em>. And if that means there's
nothing left? Then what you were about to send was pure noise, adding nothing
useful to the conversation, and hence best left unsent. Doing anything less
than this as a community leader is pure self-indulgence, putting your own
unwillingness to consider the consequences of your communications ahead of
the long term interests of your project. We're only talking about software
here, after all - lives aren't on the line when we're deciding how to respond
to a particular contribution, so we can afford to take a few moments to
review the messages we're about to send and consider how they're likely to
be perceived, both by the recipient, and by everyone else observing the
exchange.</p>
<p>With any personal abuse removed, you can be as ruthless about critiquing the
code and design as you like. Learning not to take critiques of your work
personally <em>is</em> a necessary skill to acquire if your ambition is to become a
high profile open source developer - the compromises often necessary in the
real world of software design and development mean that you <em>will</em> end up
shipping things that can legitimately be described as terrible, and you're
going to have to learn to be able to say "Yes, I know it's terrible, for
reasons X, Y, and Z, and I decided to publish it anyway. If you don't like
it, don't use it.". (I highly recommend giving talks about these areas you
know are terrible - they're fun to prepare, fun to give, and it's quite
entertaining seeing the horrified reactions when people realise I'm not
kidding when I say all software is terrible and computers don't actually
work, they just fake it fairly well through an ongoing series of horrible
hacks built atop other horrible hacks. I'm not surprised the Internet
breaks sometimes - given the decades of accumulated legacy hardware and
software we're building on and working around, it's thoroughly astonishing
that anything technology related ever works at all)</p>
<p>But no matter how harsh your technical critiques get, never forget that
there's at least one other human on the far end of that code review or
email thread. Even if you don't personally care about <em>them</em>, do you really
think it's a good idea to go through life providing large numbers of people
with public evidence of why <em>you</em> are a thoroughly unpleasant person to be
forced to deal with? As a project leader, do you really think you're going
to attract the best and brightest people, who are often free to spend their
time and energy however they like, if you set up a sign saying "You must be
willing to tolerate extensive personal abuse in order to participate here"?</p>
<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
<p>First, and foremost, for those of us that <em>are</em> paid open source community
leaders, we can recognise that understanding and motivating our contributors
and potential contributors in order to grow our communities is <em>part of our
job</em>. If we don't like that, if we'd prefer to be able to "just focus on the
code", to the degree where we're not willing to learn how to moderate our
own behaviour in accordance with our level of responsibility, then we need
to figure out how to reorganise things such that there's someone with better
people management and communication skills in a position to act as a buffer
between us and our respective communities.</p>
<p>If we instead decide we need to better educate ourselves, then there are
plenty of resources available for us to do so. For folks just beginning to
explore questions of systemic bias and defaulting to exclusivity,
gender-based bias is a good one to start with, by perusing resources like the
<a href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Feminism_101">Feminism 101</a> section on
the Geek Feminism wiki, or (if we have the opportunity) attending an
Ada Initiative
<a href="https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training/">Ally Skills workshop</a>.</p>
<p>And if we <em>do</em> acknowledge the importance of this work, then we can use our
influence to help it continue, whether that's by sponsoring educational
workshops, supporting financial assistance programs, ensuring suitable codes
of conduct are in place for our events and online communities, supporting
programs like the GNOME Outreach Program for Women, or organisations like
the Ada Initiative, and so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>For those of us that <em>aren't</em> community leaders, then one of the most
effective things we can do is vote with our feet: at last count, there are
over a million open source projects in existence, many of them are run in
such a way that participating in them is almost always a sheer pleasure,
and if no existing community grabs your interest, you always have the option
of starting your own.</p>
<p>Personal enjoyment is only one reason for participating in open source though,
and professional obligations or personal needs may bring us into contact with
project leaders and contributors that currently consider personal abuse to be
an acceptable way of interacting with their peers in a collaborative context.
If leaving isn't a viable option, then what can we do?</p>
<p>Firstly, the options I suggest above for community leaders are actually good
options for <em>any</em> participants in the open source community that view the
overall growth and success of the free and open source software ethos as
being more important than any one individual's personal pride or reluctance to
educate themselves about issues that don't affect them personally.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can hold our leaders to account. When community leaders give
presentations at community events, especially when presenting on community
management topics, feel free to ask the following questions (or variations
on these themes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we as community leaders aware of the impact current and historical
  structural inequalities have on the demographics of our community?</li>
<li>What have we done recently as individuals to improve our understanding of
  these issues and their consequences?</li>
<li>What have we done recently as community leaders to attempt to counter the
  systemic biases adversely affecting the demographics of our communities?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are questions that open source community leaders <em>should</em> be able to
answer. When we can't, I guess the silver lining is that it means we have
plenty of scope to get better at what we do. For members of vulnerable
groups, an inability for leaders to answer these questions is also a
strong sign as to which communities may not yet be able to provide safe
spaces for you to participate without experiencing harassment over your
identity rather than being critiqued solely based on the quality of your
work.</p>
<p>If you ask these questions, you <em>will</em> get people complaining about bringing
politics into a technical environment. The folks complaining are simply wrong,
as the single most important factor driving the quality of our technology is
the quality of our thinking. Assuming we have attained meritocracy (aka "the
most effective collaborative environment possible") is sheer foolishness,
when a wide array of systemic biases remain in place that work to reduce the
depth, breadth, and hence quality, of our collective thinking.</p>

                    <p>Over the weekend, Asher Wolf
<a href="https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/555909774596784129">alerted me</a> (and
many others in the open source and cryptographic communities) to the
Australian Defence Trade Controls Act 2012, and the current public
consultation taking place around a bill proposing amendments to that act.</p>
<p>Being heavily involved in improving the security of open source
infrastructure like the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/">Python Package Index</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/">Python 2 reference interpreter</a>,
working at a multinational open source vendor, and having an extensive
background in working under the constraints of the US International Traffic
in Arms regulations, Asher's concern caught my attention, since bad
legislation in this area can have significant chilling effects on legitimate
research and development activities.</p>
<p>As a result, I've escalated this legislation for review by the legal teams
at various open source companies and organisations, with a view to making
formal submissions to the
<a href="https://www.defence.gov.au/deco/Consultation.asp">public consultation process</a>
that is open until January 30th (ready for bills to be submitted for
consideration to federal parliament on February 23rd).</p>
<p>However, I was also able to attend the first public consultation session
held at the University of Queensland on January 19, so these are my
impressions based primarily on that sessions and my own experiences dealing
with ITAR. I'm not a lawyer and I haven't actually <em>read</em> the legislation,
so I'm not going to pick up on any drafting errors, but I can at least speak
to the intent of the folks involved in moving this process forward.</p>
<h2>What <em>not</em> to worry about</h2>
<p>To folks encountering this kind of legislation for the first time, the
sheer scope of the
<a href="https://www.defence.gov.au/deco/DSGL.asp">Defence and Strategic Goods List</a>
can seem absolutely terrifying. This was very clear to me from some of the
questions various academics in the room were asking.</p>
<p>On this particular point, I can only say: <em>"Don't panic"</em>. This isn't a
unique-to-Australia list, it's backed by a treaty called the
<a href="https://www.wassenaar.org/">Wassenaar Arrangement</a> - the DSGL represents
part of the implementation of that arrangement into Australian law.</p>
<p>When the laws implementing that arrangement are well drafted, everyone outside
the military industrial complex (and certain easily weaponised areas of
scientific research) can pretty much ignore them, while everyone
inside the military industrial complex (and the affected areas of research)
pays very close attention to them because we like not being in jail (and
because gunrunning is bad, and bioterrorism is worse, mmm'kay?).</p>
<p>A heavily regulated military supply chain is already scary enough, we <em>really</em>
don't want to see the likely consequences of an unregulated one. (And if
you're tempted to make a snarky comment about the latter already being the
case, no, it really isn't. While folks can sometimes use overclassification
to avoid regulations they're supposed to be following, that still introduces
significant friction and inefficiencies into whatever they're doing. It's not
as good as people actually respecting the laws of the countries they're
supposedly defending, including genuinely meeting the requirement for
civilian authority over the military, but it's still a hell of a lot better
than nothing).</p>
<p>Getting back on topic, the US ITAR and crypto export control laws are
currently considered the most strict implementation of the Wassenaar
Arrangement amongst the participating nations (going beyond the requirements
of the treaty in several areas), so if you see plenty of US nationals
participating in an activity without being fined and going to jail, you can
be fairly confident that it isn't actually a controlled activity under the
DSGL (or, even if it is, permits for that specific activity will be fairly
easy to get, and the most likely consequence of not realising you need a
permit for something you're doing will be someone from your government
getting in touch to point out that you should apply for one).</p>
<p>There are certainly some very questionable aspects of this list (with the
perennial "favourite" being the fact the Wassenaar Arrangement does, in fact,
attempt to regulate the global trade in mathematics, which is just as stupid
and problematic as it sounds), but it's a known quantity, and one we're pretty
sure we can continue to live with (at least for the time being).</p>
<h2>What to worry about</h2>
<p>The real problem here is that the regulations included in the 2012 Act are
<em>not</em> well drafted, and the legislated 2 year transition period from May 2013
through to May 2015 prior to the enforcement provisions kicking in is about
to run out.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the 2012 act is that in trying to keep things simple
(essentially, "if its on the DSGL, you need a permit"), it ended up becoming
extraordinarily draconian, requiring a permit for things that don't require
an export license even under ITAR.</p>
<p>For the general public, the most significant shift in the 2015 amendment bill
is the fact that several cases around open publication of information related
to dual-use technologies shift to being allowed by default, and only in
exceptional cases would a permit be required (and in those cases, the onus
would be on the government to inform the covered individuals of that
requirement).</p>
<p>The amendments also include a variety of additional exemptions for little
things like making it legal for Australian's own police and security agencies
to collaborate with their international counterparts. (Snarky comment
opportunity #2: in certain areas, making such collaboration illegal seems
like a potentially attractive idea...)</p>
<p>That 2 year pilot was included in the original legislation as a safety
mechanism, the feedback from the associated steering group has been
extensive, and if things had gone according to plan, the relevant amendments
to the bill would have been passed last year in the spring sitting of federal
parliament, leaving DECO with at least 6 months to educate affected
organisations and individuals, and start issuing the now necessary permits
before the enforcement provisions became active in May. Unfortunately, we
currently have a federal government that views pushing a particular
ideological agenda as being more important than <em>actually doing their job</em>,
so we're now faced with the prospect of regulations that industry doesn't
want, academia doesn't want, the Australian public service don't want, and
the Australian military don't want, coming into effect anyway.</p>
<p>Isn't politics fun?</p>
<h2>What DECO are (trying) to do about it</h2>
<p>The group tasked with untangling this particular legislative Charlie Foxtrot
is the Australian Defence Export Control Office (DECO). Their proposal for
addressing the situation hinges on two bills that they plan to put before
the next sitting of federal parliament:</p>
<ul>
<li>an amendment bill for the Act itself, which fixes it to be a conventional
  implementation of the Wassenaar Arrangement, in line with existing
  implementations in other Wassenaar nations (why we didn't just do that in
  the first place is beyond me, but at least DECO are trying to fix the
  mistake now)</li>
<li>a second bill to delay the enactment of the enforcement provisions for
  a further six months to provide sufficient time for DECO to properly
  educate affected parties and start issuing permits</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I am aware, the second bill is needed primarily due to the
consideration of the first bill slipping by six months, since we're now
looking at the prospect of only having 4 weeks for DECO to start issuing
permits before the enforcement provisions come into effect. <em>Nobody</em> involved
thinks that's a good idea.</p>
<p>If both of those bills pass promptly, then the only cause for concern is
whether or not there are any remaining devils in the details of the
legislation itself. Member of the general public aren't going to be able to
pick those up - despite the surface similarities, legalese isn't English, and
reading it without interpreting it in the context of relevant case law can be
a good way to get yourself into trouble. Summary translations from legalese
to English by a competent lawyer are a much safer bet, although still not
perfect. (For the programmers reading this: I personally find it useful
to think of legalese as source code that runs on the language interpreter of
a given nation's legal system, while the English translations are the code
comments and documentation that anyone should be able to read if they
understand the general concepts involved).</p>
<p>If at least the second bill passes, then we have another 6 months to work on
a better resolution to the problem.</p>
<p>If <em>neither</em> bill passes, then DECO end up in a bad situation where they'll
be required by law to implement and enforce regulations that they're
convinced are a bad idea. They actually have everything in place to do that
if they have to, but they don't want this outcome, and neither does anyone
else.</p>
<h2>What industry and academia can do about it</h2>
<p>While it's very short notice, the main thing industry and academia can do
is to file formal submissions with DECO as described in their overview of
the <a href="https://www.defence.gov.au/deco/Consultation.asp">public consultation process</a>.</p>
<p>There are three main things to be addressed on that front:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring federal parliament are aware of the importance of amending the
  Defence Trade Controls Act 2012 to eliminate the more draconian provisions</li>
<li>ensuring federal parliament are aware of the infeasibility of putting this
  into effect on the original timeline and the need for a significant delay
  in the introduction of the enforcement provisions</li>
<li>ensuring DECO are alerted to any remaining areas of concern in the
  specific drafting of the amended legislation (although I'd advise skipping
  this one if you're not a lawyer yourself - it's the functional equivalent
  of a lawyer with no training as a programmer proposing patches to the Linux
  kernel)</li>
</ul>
<p>We were apparently asleep at the wheel when DTCA went through in 2012, so
we owe a <em>lot</em> of thanks to whoever it was that advocated for and achieved
the inclusion of the two year transition and consultation period in the
original bill. Now we need to help ensure that our currently somewhat
dysfunctional federal parliament doesn't keep us from receiving the benefit
of that foresight.</p>
<h2>What's definitely not going to happen</h2>
<p>This consultation process is <em>not</em> the place to rail against the details of
the Wassenaar Arrangement or Australia's participation in it. You won't
achieve anything except to waste the time of folks that currently have a
really serious problem to fix, and a very limited window in which to fix it.</p>
<p>Yes, Wassenaar has some serious problems, especially around its handling
of cryptography and cryptographic research, but we have a fairly settled
approach to handling that at this point in history. The critical concern in
this current case is to help DECO ensure that the associated Australian
regulations can be readily handled through the mechanisms that have already
been put in place to handle existing Wassenaar enforcement regimes in other
countries. With the way the 2012 Act was drafted, that's almost certainly
currently not the case, but the proposed 2015 amendments <em>should</em> fix it
(assuming the amendments actually have the effects that DECO has indicated
they're intended to).</p>

                    <h2>Kallithea for CPython</h2>
<p>The CPython core development team are currently evaluating our options for
modernising our core development workflows to better match the standards
set by other projects and services like OpenStack and GitHub.</p>
<p>The first step in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0474/">my own proposal</a>
for that is to migrate a number of the support repositories currently hosted
using a basic Mercurial server on hg.python.org to an instance of
<a href="https://kallithea-scm.org/">Kallithea</a> hosted as forge.python.org.
(Kallithea is a GPLv3 Python project that was forked from RhodeCode after
certain aspects of the latter's commercialisation efforts started alienating
several members of their user and developer community)</p>
<p>Tymoteusz Jankowski (a contributor to Allegro Group's open source data centre
inventory management system, <a href="https://ralph.allegrogroup.com/">Ralph</a>), has
already started looking at the steps that might be involved in integrating a
Kallithea instance into the PSF's Salt based
<a href="https://github.com/xliiv/psf-salt/tree/kallithea">infrastructure automation</a>.</p>
<p>However, for my proposal to be as successful as I would like it to be, I need
the barriers to entry for the development and deployment of the upstream
Kallithea project itself to be as low as possible. One of the challenges
we've often had with gaining contributors to CPython infrastructure
maintenance is the relatively high barriers to entry for trying out service
changes and sharing them with others, so this time I plan to tackle that
concern <em>first</em>, by ensuring that addressing it is a mandatory requirement
in my proposal.</p>
<p>That means tackling two particular problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a way to easily run local test instances for development and
  experimentation</li>
<li>Having a way to easily share demonstration instances with others</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first problem, I plan to rely on Vagrant and Docker, while for the
second I'll be relying on the free tier in Red Hat's OpenShift Online
service. Unfortunately, while the
<a href="https://www.openshift.org/">next generation</a> of OpenShift will support Docker
images natively, for the time being, I need to tackle these as two separate
problems, as there aren't any existing Docker based services I'm aware of
with a free tier that is similarly suited to the task of sharing development
prototypes for open source web services with a broad audience (let alone
any such services that are also
<a href="https://github.com/openshift">fully open source</a>).</p>
<p>Once I have these working to my satisfaction, I'll propose them to the
Kallithea team for inclusion in the Kallithea developer documentation, but
in the meantime I'll just document them here on the blog.</p>
<h2>Enabling Kallithea deployment on OpenShift</h2>
<p>My first priority is to get a public demonstration instance up and running
that I can start tweaking towards the CPython core development community's
needs (e.g. installing the custom repo hooks we run on hg.python.org), so
I'm starting by figuring out the OpenShift setup needed to run public
instances - the Vagrant/Docker based setup for local development will come
later.</p>
<p>Conveniently, WorldLine previously created an <a href="https://github.com/worldline/openshift-rhodecode">OpenShift quickstart for
RhodeCode</a> and published
it under the Apache License 2.0, so I was able to use that as a starting
point for my own
<a href="https://github.com/ncoghlan/openshift-kallithea">Kallithea quickstart</a>.</p>
<p>While I personally prefer to run Python web services under mod_wsgi in order
to take advantage of Apache's authentication &amp; authorisation plugin ecosystem,
that's not a significant concern for the demonstration server use case I have
in mind here. There are also some other aspects in the WorldLine quickstart
I'd like to understand better and potentially change (like figuring out a
better way of installing git that doesn't involve hardcoding a particular
version), but again, not a big deal for demonstration instances - rather
than worrying about them too much, I just annotated them as <code>TODO</code> comments
in the OpenShift hook source code.</p>
<p>I'd also prefer to be running under the official Python 2.7 cartridge rather
than a DIY cartridge, but again, my focus at this point is on getting
something up and running, and then iterating from there to improve it.</p>
<p>That meant adapting the quickstart from RhodeCode to Kallithea was mostly
just a matter of changing the names of the various components being installed
and invoked, together with changing the actual installation and upgrade steps
to be based on Kallithea's deployment instructions.</p>
<p>The keys to this are the
<a href="https://github.com/ncoghlan/openshift-kallithea/blob/master/.openshift/action_hooks/build">build hook</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/ncoghlan/openshift-kallithea/blob/master/.openshift/action_hooks/start">start hook</a>.
The <a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-action-hooks.html">OpenShift docs</a>
have more details on the various available action hooks and when they're run.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>TODO</code> comments noted above, I also added various comments
explaining <em>what</em> different parts of the action hook scripts were doing.</p>
<p>(Note: I haven't actually <em>tested</em> an upgrade, only the initial
deployment described below, so I can't be sure I have actually adapted the
upgrade handling correctly yet)</p>
<h2>Deploying my own Kallithea instance</h2>
<p>I already have an OpenShift account, so I could
<a href="https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new">skip that step</a>, and just
create a new app under my existing account. However, I didn't have the command
line tools installed, so that was the first step in creating my own instance:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo yum install /usr/bin/rhc
</pre></div>

<p>yum is able to figure out on my behalf that it is <code>rubygems-rhc</code> that
provides the command line tools for OpenShift in Fedora (alternatively,
I could have looked that up myself in the
<a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-client-tools.html#fedora">OpenShift client tools installation docs</a>).</p>
<p>The next step was to configure the command line tools to use my OpenShift
Online account, generate a local login token for this machine, and upload
my public SSH key to OpenShift Online. That process involved working through
the interactive prompts in:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">rhc setup
</pre></div>

<p>With those preliminary OpenShift steps out of the way, it was time to
move on to deploying the application itself. It's worth noting that
app creation automatically clones a local git repo named after the application,
so I created a separate "app_repos" subdirectory in my development directory
specifically so I could call my OpenShift app "kallithea" without conflicting
with my local clone of the main kallithea repo.</p>
<p>As described in the quickstart README, the app creation command is:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">rhc app create kallithea diy-0.1 postgresql-9.2
</pre></div>

<p>That churned away for a while, and then attempted to clone the app repo
locally over ssh (with SSH putting up a prompt to accept the validity of the
app's freshly generated SSH key). I'm not sure why, but for some reason that
automatic clone operation didn't work for me. <code>rhc</code> put up a detailed
message explaining that the app creation had worked, but the clone step had
failed. Fortunately, as the troubleshooting notice suggested, a subsequent
<code>rhc git-clone kallithea</code> worked as expected.</p>
<p>OpenShift provides a default app skeleton automatically, but I actually
want to get rid of that and replace it with the contents of the quickstart
repo:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">rm -R diy .openshift misc README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Remove template files"
git remote add quickstart -m master https://github.com/ncoghlan/openshift-kallithea.git
git pull -s recursive -X theirs quickstart master
</pre></div>

<p>The default merge commit message that popped up was fine, so I just accepted
that and moved on to the most interesting step:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git push
</pre></div>

<p>Because this is the first build, there's a lot of output related to
installing and building the PostgreSQL driver and git, before moving on
to installing Kallithea and its dependencies.</p>
<p>However, that still didn't take long, and completed without errors, so I now
have my own Kallithea instance
<a href="https://kallithea-ncoghlan.rhcloud.com/">up and running</a>.</p>
<p>And no, the default admin credentials created by the quickstart won't work
anymore - I immediately logged in to the admin account to change them!</p>
<h2>Where to from here?</h2>
<p>There are various aspects of the current quickstart that are far from ideal,
but I don't plan to spend a lot of time worrying about it when I know that
support for using Docker images directly in OpenShift is coming at some
point in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Docker is the much nicer approach it offers to
layered application development where infrastructure experts can provide
base images for others to build on, and in the case of deploying Python
applications with mod_wsgi, that means listening to Graham Dumpleton (the
author of mod_wsgi, currently working for New Relic).</p>
<p>On that front, Graham has actually been
<a href="https://blog.dscpl.com.au/2014/12/hosting-python-wsgi-applications-using.html">working on</a>
creating a set of Debian based
<a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/grahamdumpleton/mod-wsgi-docker/">mod_wsgi Docker images</a>
that Python developers can use, rather than having to build their own from
scratch.</p>
<p>In my case, I'd really prefer something based on CentOS 7 or Fedora Cloud,
but that's a relatively minor quibble, and Graham's images should still make
a great basis for putting together a Vagrant+Docker based local workflow
for folks working on Kallithea.</p>
<p>That, however, is a topic for a future post :)</p>
