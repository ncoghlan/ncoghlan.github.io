<html><body><p>So, I occasionally post stuff over at <a href="http://www.talkinboutstuff.net" target="_top">Talkinboutstuff</a>. However, that's mostly for random crap I expect the rest of the guys to find interesting/annoying/whatever.
<br>
<br>So, I created this extra blog for myself - somewhere to pontificate about things I <i>don't</i> expect them to find interesting, like software and Python and open source and what have you. And, anything of interest to them can be cross-linked quite happily :)
<br>
<br>Maybe I'll even get around to attaching this thing to a real domain name!</p></body></html>
