<html><body><p>Inspired by Michael Foord's efforts with <span>unittest2</span>, <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/">contextlib2</a> is a PyPI package where I am working on some new additions to the standard library's <span>contextlib</span> module for Python 3.3.<br><br>The most interesting of those is a replacement for the ill-fated <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/contextlib#contextlib.nested">contextlib.nested</a> API.<br><br>If you use Python 3.2 today, you'll find that the <span>contextlib.nested</span> API doesn't even exist any more. The reason it was deprecated and removed is because it didn't play well with context managers that acquired their resources in <span>__init__</span> rather than <span>__enter__</span> (such as Python's own file objects and many other resources where using a with statement for management is an optional convenience rather than being mandatory).<br><br>The simplest example where the old API caused problems was opening a list of files and then using <span>contextlib.nested</span> to close them all when the operation was complete - if opening any later file threw an exception (e.g. due to a permissions error or a bad file name), then all of the earlier files would remain open until the garbage collector got around to cleaning them up. Not a huge problem on CPython with its refcounting based GC, but a far cry from the deterministic resource cleanup that context managers are supposed to offer.<br><br>Since the deprecation and removal of <span>contextlib.nested</span>, there have been assorted replacement proposals of varying levels of sophistication posted to the Python ideas mailing list. The new <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#contextlib2.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> API in this release is my own latest effort, and the first that I've liked well enough to seriously consider as a candidate for inclusion in the standard library module.<br><br>The idea behind providing the <span>ExitStack</span> API is for the standard library to focus specifically on handling the one particularly tricky part of dealing with context managers programmatically: unwinding the context stack correctly, ensuring that exceptions are processed exactly as if any context managers involved had been used in an appropriate series of nested with statements.<br><br>A couple of convenience methods are included (one that enters a context manager in addition to pushing the exit method on to the stack, as well as a simple callback registration method inspired by <span>unittest.TestCase.addCleanup</span>), but the features of the API are otherwise fairly minimal.<br><br>This low level dynamic API can then be used by developers to create their own higher level convenience APIs, as suggested in some of the <a href="http://contextlib2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#replacing-any-use-of-try-finally-and-flag-variables">examples</a> in the documentation.<br><br>A few specific design notes:<br></p><ul><li>The name <span>ExitStack</span> came about because the object is literally a stack of exit method references (or callback wrappers that behave like exit methods). Earlier variants were <span>ContextStack</span> (too narrow, since you can use the stack for standalone callbacks) and <span>CallbackStack</span> (too broad, since the stored callbacks specifically have the signature of exit methods)</li><li>The <span>push()</span> method accepts exit methods directly, since those are what actually gets stored on the stack. Ducktyping to also accept objects with an <span>__exit__()</span> method is convenient without being confusing (I hope).</li><li>The <span>enter_context()</span> method uses the longer name because the shorter version is too easy to confuse with the stack's own <span>__enter__()</span> method.</li></ul>If you have any questions about the <span>ExitStack</span> design, this is the place to ask.
