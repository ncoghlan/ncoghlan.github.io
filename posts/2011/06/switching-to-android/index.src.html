<html><body><p>So my new HTC Desire S arrived today which means it is time for an app downloading spree... (starting with just freebies for now while I figure out what I do and don't like, and delete some of the cruft that HTC/Telstra added)<br><br>Already grabbed:<br>Google Goggles<br>Google Sky<br>Google Reader<br>Dropbox<br>Firefox<br>KeepassDroid<br>OI File Manager<br>Shelves for Android (now actually *scanning* my book collection will be quite a project...)<br>Barcode Scanner<br>Compass<br><br>And a ton of standard apps from Google/HTC/Telstra for all the basics (Phone, SMS, Music, Mail/Gmail, FB, Twitter, Camera, Calendar, Clock, Weather, Calculator, Adobe PDF Reader, Maps/Navigation, LED Flashlight, etc).<br><br>Things I know I want but don't have yet:<br><br>Ebook reader (I used Stanza from Lexcycle on the iPhone, but they don't make an Android version)<br>Weight tracker (don't need anything fancy, just something that I can import old data into and will give me a time-weighted average)<br><br>I'm also open to suggestions for things I might want but just don't know it yet, and of course I'll have to track down a few idle time games.</p></body></html>
