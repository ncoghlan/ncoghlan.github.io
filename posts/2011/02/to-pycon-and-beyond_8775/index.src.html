<html><body><div><p>All these Planet Python posts about interesting talks and info at Pycon finally tipped me over the edge into making the trek across the Pacific to meet some of these people I've been working with online for the past half-dozen years or so.</p><p>With 3.3 still 18-24 months away, we should be able to get a pretty good road map thrashed out for ideas we want to explore for possible inclusion. Some face-to-face discussions will be especially handy for me, given the things I'd like to see sorted out: module aliasing to clean up __main__ handling once and for all, bringing back implicit context managers now we have more collective experience with explicit ones, an alternative to PEP 377 that will allow context managers to do some additional setup inside the scope of the try block, clarifying the semantic questions raised by discrepancies between the PEP 3118 buffer API spec and its implementation.</p><p>I still have some paperwork to sort out once my renewed passport arrives, but aside from that, the trip is good to go. I did stuff my travel dates up a bit and will have a day to kill in Atlanta on the 9th, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure out something interesting to do :)</p></div></body></html>
