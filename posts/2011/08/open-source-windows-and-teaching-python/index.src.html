<html><body><p>A few questions and incidents recently prompted me to reflect on why I don't help with CPython support on Windows, even though I use Windows happily enough on my gaming system. Since this ended up being a rather pro-Linux article and upfront disclosure is a good thing, I'll note that while I do work for Red Hat now, that's a very recent thing - my adoption of Linux as my preferred development platform dates back to 2004 or so. I work for Red Hat because I like Linux, not the other way around :)<br><br></p><h2>The Availability of Professional Development Tools</h2>I <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2011-August/113111.html">don't make a secret</a> of my dislike of Windows as a hobbyist development platform. While Microsoft have improved things in recent years (primarily by releasing the Express editions of Visual Studio), there's still a huge difference between an operating system like GNU/Linux, which was built by developers for developers based on a foundation that was built by academics for academics, and Windows, which was built by a company that used deals with computer manufacturers to get it into end users' hands regardless of technical merit. Developers were forced to follow in order to reach that large installed user base. Those different histories are reflected in the different development cultures that surround the respective platforms.<br><br>To get the same tool chain that professional Linux companies use, you don't need to do anything special - Linux distributions include the tools used to create them. If you have a distribution, you have everything you need to build applications for that distribution, including documentation. With the open source nature of the platform and almost all of the software (the occasionally binary driver notwithstanding), there's a vast range of tools out there to help you get things done (although sorting through the mass can be a little tricky sometimes, since it can be hard to tell the difference between stuff that doesn't exist and stuff that exists, but hasn't been uncovered by your research).<br><br>As far as I'm aware, Mac OS X isn't quite as generous with freely available development utilities, but isn't all that far off the Linux approach (I'm not a Mac user or developer though, so there may be more hurdles than I am aware of - I recall some muttering about Apple beginning to charge a small fee for XCode. My opinion is based mostly on the fact that it seems pretty easy to find open source devs that use Macs). With the POSIX-ish underpinnings, many of the utilities from the *nix world also work in this environment.<br><br>The minimum realistic standard for professional Windows development, though, is an MSDN subscription (to get full access to the OS documentation and various utilities), along with a professional copy of Visual Studio. The tools available for free (including the Express editions of Visual Studio) are clearly second rate. Even when the tools themselves are OK, the licensing restrictions on the applications they create may make them practically useless (and MS have the gall to call the GPL viral - at least the gcc team don't restrict how you license and distribute the binaries it creates). So why should a hobbyist develop for a system that thinks they should pay substantial sums for the privilege of developing for it, instead of one that welcomes all contributors, providing not only the end product, but the ingredients and recipes all for free?<br><br>At the recent PyConAU sprints, one of the contributors (an existing Linux user that happened to have a Windows only laptop with them) became frustrated with getting all the necessary tools set up to work properly on Windows (configuring git+ssh for read/write access to a GitHub repo was one key point of irritation), and decided to dual boot Ubuntu on the machine instead. Twenty minutes later, she was up and running and hacking on the project she originally wanted to hack on. Granted, she already knew how to use Linux, but seriously, there's something fundamentally wrong with a platform when installing and dual-booting to a different OS is the easiest way to get a decent development environment up and running.<br><br>All that ends up putting cross-platform languages like Python in an interesting position: when developing with Python, you can often get away with <i>not</i> understanding the underlying details of your operating system, because the language runtime tries to provide a largely standardised interface on all platforms. However, many open source developers either don't use Windows at all, or genuinely dislike programming for it, so the burden of making things work properly on Windows falls on the shoulders of a comparatively small number of people, either those who genuinely like programming for the platform (yes, such people exist, I'm just not one of them), or those that are looking for any niche where they can usefully contribute and are happy enough to take on the task of improving Windows compatibility and support.<br><br>I don't have particularly hard numbers to back this up (other than the skew in core developer numbers vs overall OS popularity), but my intuition is that, at least for CPython, the user:core developer ratio is orders of magnitude higher for Windows than it is for Linux or Mac OS X.<br><br><h2>The Implications for Teaching Python on Windows</h2>Something cool that is going on at the moment is that a lot of folks are interested in the idea of teaching more people how to program with Python as the language used. However, the potential students (young and old) that they are wanting to teach often don't have any development experience at all and are using the most common consumer operating system (i.e. Windows). So good Windows support, and an easy installation experience are important considerations for these instructors. A request that is frequently made (with varying levels of respect and politeness), is that the official python.org Windows installer be updated to automatically adjust the PATH (or at least provide the option to do so), so that Python can be launched from the command line by typing "python" instead of something like "C:\Python27\python".<br><br>If educators want that <i>right now</i> their best bet is actually to direct their students towards the Windows versions of ActiveState's <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads">ActivePython Community Edition</a>. ActiveState add a few things to the standard installer, like PATH manipulation and additional packages (such as pywin32). They also bundle PyPM, which is a decent tool for getting PyPI packages on to Windows machines (at least, I've heard good things about it - I haven't actually used it myself). (That said, I believe I may need to caveat that recommendation a bit: as near as I can tell from their website, PyPM has been deliberately disabled for their 64-bit Windows Community Edition installer. Still, even in that case, you can easily grab additional packages direct from PyPI via "pip install" on the command line)<br><br>Brian Curtin is working on adding optional PATH manipulation to the python.org installer for 3.3, and there's a chance such a change might be backported to the next maintenance releases for 3.2 and 2.7 (no promises, though). Even if it does make it in, it will still be a while before the change is part of a binary release (especially given that Brian has only just started tinkering with it).<br><br>This is clearly a nice thing for beginners, especially those that aren't in the habit of tinkering with their OS settings, but I do honestly wonder how much of a difference it will make in the long run. In many ways, software development is one long exercise in frustration. You decide you want to fix bug X. But it turns out bug X is really due to bug Y. You could work around Y just to fix X, but the bigger bug would still be there. But then you discover that fixing bug Y properly requires feature Z, which doesn't exist yet, so a workaround (even an ugly one) starts to sound pretty attractive. "Yak shaving" (the highly technical term for things that you're working on solely because they're a prerequisite for what you actually <i>want</i> to be working on) is so common it's almost the norm rather than the exception. The many and varied frustrations of trying to use Windows as a hobbyist open source developer also won't magically go away just because the python.org installer starts automating one environment variable update - as soon as people are introduced to sites like GitHub and BitBucket, they'll get to discover the joy that is SSH and source control on Windows. If they get past that hurdle, they'll likely start to encounter the multitude open source projects that don't even <i>offer</i> Windows installers (if the project supports Windows at all), because their Windows developer count stands at a grand total of zero.<br><br><h2>Final Thoughts</h2>I hope the people teaching Python to beginners on Windows and the folks working on improving Windows support don't take this article as an attack on their efforts. I find both goals to be quite admirable, and wish those involved all the success they can find. But there are reasons I abandoned Windows as a personal development platform ~7 years ago and taught myself to use Linux instead. As far as I can tell, most of those reasons remain valid today, even after Microsoft started releasing the Express versions of Visual Studio in an attempt to stem the flood of hobbyist developers jumping ship.<br><br>The <a href="/2011/08/of-python-and-road-maps-or-lack-thereof.html">other day</a> I called the relative lack of Windows developers in open source a vicious cycle and I stand by that. If someone can learn to program, mastering Linux is going to be comparatively easy. For anyone seriously interested in open source development, using Linux (even in a virtual machine, the way I do on my gaming laptop) is by far the path of least resistance. Getting more Windows developers in open source requires that people care sufficiently about Windows as a platform that they don't just switch to Linux, but care about open source enough to start contributing at all, and that seems to be a genuinely rare combination.</body></html>
