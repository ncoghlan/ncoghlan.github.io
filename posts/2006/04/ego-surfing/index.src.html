<html><body><p>So, one of Techdirt's latest stories led me back to <a href="http://www.canton.elegal.ca/archives/2006/02/internet_privac.html">this article</a> about the perils of putting too much personal info on line. Possibly even things like having the words "boredom" and "laziness" as part of a domain name you own, and then not updating the associated website for months on end, so people googling your name can wonder about your follow-through when it comes to keeping up with projects you start*.<br><br>Anyway, as a result I did a bit of googling of my own. It used to be that Google gave me <a href="/2004/12/google-footprint.html"> far more prominence</a> than one might expect, with buckets of references to python-list and python-dev posts. When I noticed those posts weren't on the first list of results anymore, and links for both the actor and the surfer were now included, I thought Google might have done something to give the non-mailing list results more importance, and give a result that better reflected mainstream celebrity.<br><br>A closer look though and I find that while the list of sites has changed, my original opinion still holds: even with a lot more mainstream media moving online, your Google footprint still says far more about your online presence than your fame (or lack thereof) in the offline world. And I still manage to find that fact both obvious and intriguing at the same time :)<br><br>*(FWIW, most of the stuff I write online is Python related, and ends up on the Python mailing lists rather than here)</p></body></html>
